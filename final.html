  		<h4> On Feminism in the Age of Consumption </h4>
      <p><em>written by Nicki Lisa Cole and Alison Dahl Crossley</em></p>
  			<p> In an age in which women’s independence and achievement are often framed by and articulated through consumer discourses and practices, what does this mean for the future of feminism and feminist identities? We wonder about such consequences precisely because the consumer lifestyle, as the cultural logic of capitalism, is a fundamentally un-feminist thing. The epistemological foundation of feminism and feminist identity historically has been the eradication of inequalities. <span id = "indented" style="color: #a31414;">Thus, feminism is diametrically opposed to consumer practices which support the dominance of global capitalism: a system which thrives on the exploitation of labor, theft of resources, and facilitates vast accumulation of wealth among a tiny percentage of global elite, while simultaneously impoverishing the majority of the world’s population.</span> Further,since consuming is a singular act of identity formation and expression, we question whether women’s empowerment through consumption at the individual level undermines the possibility of gendered social change at the collective level. In responding to these questions in this essay we critically interrogate the intersection of discourses of women’s independence with discourses and practices of consumption, with an eye for contemporary attitudes toward and definitions of feminism. </p>

  			<p style = "font-size: 30px;"> The negative effects of consumerism include the depletion of natural resources and pollution of the Earth. The way the consumer society is working is not sustainable. We are currently overusing Earth’s natural resources with more than 70 percent. <span id = "indented">If everyone on earth lived like the average American we would need 5.2 planets to support us. The number is 3 if everyone lived like the average Japanese and about 3.3 as Europeans. </span>And the number of people in the consumer class is growing…

  			<p style = "font-size: 24px;"> Amnesty International’s research shows that TikTok’s very business model is inherently abusive and privileges engagement to keep users hooked on the platform, in order to collect evermore data about them. <span id = "indented" style="color: #a31414;">TikTok then uses this data to create profiles of users and draw inferences about them, which allows it to cluster users in groups to target them with highly personalized content to keep them engaged. These groups and categories are also made available to advertisers so that they can target users with personalised ads.</span>
        </p>
        <p style = "font-size: 24px;"> To the extent that TikTok has put in place policies and practices to ensure greater respect of children’s rights, they differ from region to region, leaving children and young people in some parts of the world exposed to exploitative data collection in others.</p>
