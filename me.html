  			<h4> Mass Consumerism </h4>
        <p id = "indented"> uncountable noun </p>
  			<p>Consumerism is a social and economic order in which the goals of many individuals include the acquisition of goods and services beyond those that are necessary for survival or for traditional displays of status.</p>

  			<h4> Self-Image </h4>
        <p id = "indented"> noun </p>
  			<p>Self-image is the personal view, or mental picture, that we have of ourselves. Self-image is an “internal dictionary” that describes the characteristics of the self, including such things as intelligent, beautiful, ugly, talented, selfish, and kind.</p>

      <h4> How are they related?</h4>
        <p> In today's society, mass consumerism often fosters a culture of materialism and superficiality, where individuals are constantly bombarded with messages urging them to acquire more possessions and adhere to certain societal standards of beauty and success. <span id = "indented" style="color: #a31414;">This relentless pursuit of material wealth and external validation can have detrimental effects on one's self-image and mental well-being.</span>As people equate their self-worth with their possessions and outward appearance, they may experience feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and low self-esteem when they inevitably fall short of unrealistic standards perpetuated by consumer culture.</p>

        <h4 id = "h4me"> What do algorithms have to do with this? </h4>
        <p> The relentless nature of TikTok's ad algorithms, continuously suggesting similar content, often inundates users with advertisements that are not always aligned with the content they truly enjoy. <span id = "indented"> In fact, the algorithm now rewards content creators more when they post frequently, as well as when they promote certain items (TikTok Shop). This has led to a variety of controversies regarding which advertisements are genuine or sponsored. </span></p>
      <p> <span id = "indented">These algorithms perpetuate an unattainable standard of beauty and success, creating a never-ending cycle of inadequacy and comparison. </span>As users are bombarded with ads promoting products that promise to enhance their appearance or elevate their status, <span id = "indented">they're subtly reminded of capitalism's assertion that financial prosperity is intrinsically tied to beauty. </span></p>
      <p> This also affects us psychologically. Since a sense of inclusion is important for humans, this algorithm forces us to feel as if the only way to feel included is to follow these standards and to "buy certain things" for the purpose of "being better." </p>

  			<h4 id = "h4me" style="color: #a31414;"> When did this start? </h4>
  			<p> After 1890, women's connection to consumerism became more pronounced, signaling a shift towards viewing consumption not just as buying goods, but as adopting a whole lifestyle. <span id = "indented" style="color: #a31414;"> This was illustrated in Thorstein Veblen's critique of conspicuous consumption, which emphasized how women displayed their social status through the goods they owned. </span> However, women weren't merely passive participants in this consumer culture—they actively engaged with and responded to the changing economy. Shopping evolved from a practical task into a leisure activity, akin to attending a show or dining out.</p>
  			<p> Places like New York City's "Ladies Mile" became popular destinations where women could both shop and socialize, emphasizing the pleasure of browsing and interacting with products. Merchants capitalized on this by enticing women with elaborate displays and convenient services, fostering desires for goods and encouraging impulse buying. <span id = "indented" style="color: #a31414;"> This historical context sheds light on why modern propaganda, such as that seen on platforms like TikTok, is effective. Just as in the past, advertisers exploit people's desires and aspirations, leveraging consumer culture to influence behavior and shape perceptions.</span></p>

   <h4> What can we do? </h4>
   <p>Addressing the pervasive influence of consumerism-driven propaganda, particularly concerning women's self-image, requires a multifaceted approach. Media literacy education and stricter regulations on advertising practices are crucial steps to empower individuals and mitigate harmful effects. Promoting diverse representation and fostering supportive communities can counteract narrow beauty standards and promote inclusivity. By advocating for broader societal changes and fostering critical awareness, we can create a media landscape that celebrates authenticity and values individuals beyond material possessions or appearance.</p>
